    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>1. Problem-Solving Techniques in Nature</h2>
        <p>This course has highlighted the fascinating observation that many fundamental problem-solving techniques are mirrored in nature. 
            <ul>
                <li>**Iteration:** The cyclical nature of seasons, the rhythmic beating of a heart, and the repetitive patterns in biological systems all exemplify iterative processes.</li>
                <li>**Recursion:** The branching structure of trees, the self-similarity observed in fractals, and the hierarchical organization of biological systems demonstrate the power of recursion.</li>
                <li>**Backtracking:** The process of natural selection, where organisms evolve by "backtracking" from less successful variations, provides a compelling example of this technique.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

        <h2>2. Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Understanding the concepts of space and time efficiency is crucial for developing effective algorithms. 
            <ul>
                <li>**Space Efficiency** refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution.</li>
                <li>**Time Efficiency** describes how the algorithm's running time scales with the size of the input data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By analyzing the order of growth of an algorithm's time complexity (e.g., constant, logarithmic, linear, quadratic, exponential), we can predict its performance on different input sizes and make informed decisions about which algorithm is most suitable for a given problem.</p>
