A project on Urban Navigation and Safety using the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms 
Course Project: Urban Navigation and Safety System
Overview:
The Urban Navigation and Safety System is a real-world application of algorithms and data structures aimed at improving urban mobility and personal safety. The system integrates real-time traffic data, dynamic city map updates, and user-centric features to optimize travel routes, ensure safety, and provide users with intelligent navigation options.

Key Features:
Estimated Travel Time Calculation:

Algorithm Used: Dijkstra's Algorithm or A* for optimal route calculation considering real-time traffic, historical data, and road conditions.
Use Case: Users can input their starting point and destination to receive an estimated travel time.
Personal Safety Features:

Algorithm Used: Graph Search Algorithms for analyzing the safest routes, considering crime data and real-time alerts.
Use Case: Panic button feature sends an alert to emergency contacts or authorities with real-time location.
Adding New Locations:

Algorithm Used: Graph Updates with new nodes (locations) to keep the system's city map current and accurate.
Use Case: Users or city officials can add new developments (e.g., buildings, roads, amenities) to the system.
Multiple Route Viewing:

Algorithm Used: Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra’s or A*) to generate and display multiple route options between two locations.
Use Case: Users can choose the best route based on preferences like travel time, distance, or avoiding congested areas.
Travel History and Analysis:

Algorithm Used: Data Structures like hashmaps or trees for storing and analyzing past travel data.
Use Case: Users can review their travel history and identify patterns to optimize future trips.
Project Repository:
Frontend: Develop user interface designs for displaying maps, routes, and safety features.
Backend: Implement algorithms for real-time traffic data handling, map updates, and emergency features.
Algorithms: Optimization of algorithms for route calculation, travel history analysis, and real-time updates.
Data: Utilize traffic data, city infrastructure data, and user travel history for testing and validation of features.
Conclusion:
The Urban Navigation and Safety System integrates fundamental algorithmic principles with real-world challenges in urban mobility and personal safety. By applying algorithms such as Dijkstra’s and A*, and utilizing efficient data structures like graphs and hashmaps, the project aims to provide a robust solution for everyday urban travel. The project not only enhances user experience through intelligent route optimization but also ensures personal safety through real-time alerts and safety features.
