## Key Features:
### Estimated Travel Time Calculation:

Algorithm Used: Dijkstra's Algorithm or A* for optimal route calculation considering real-time traffic, historical data, and road conditions.
Use Case: Users can input their starting point and destination to receive an estimated travel time.


### Personal Safety Features:

Algorithm Used: Graph Search Algorithms for analyzing the safest routes, considering crime data and real-time alerts.
Use Case: Panic button feature sends an alert to emergency contacts or authorities with real-time location.


### Adding New Locations:

Algorithm Used: Graph Updates with new nodes (locations) to keep the system's city map current and accurate.
Use Case: Users or city officials can add new developments (e.g., buildings, roads, amenities) to the system.


### Multiple Route Viewing:

Algorithm Used: Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra’s or A*) to generate and display multiple route options between two locations.
Use Case: Users can choose the best route based on preferences like travel time, distance, or avoiding congested areas.


### Travel History and Analysis:

Algorithm Used: Data Structures like hashmaps or trees for storing and analyzing past travel data.
Use Case: Users can review their travel history and identify patterns to optimize future trips.


## Project Repository:
Frontend: Develop user interface designs for displaying maps, routes, and safety features.
